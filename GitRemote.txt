The Remote Git Repository
Until now, we have been working only in the local repository. Each developer will work in their local repository but eventually,
they will push the code into a remote repository. Once the code is in the remote repository, other developers can see and modify that code.

GitHub

Here we will be using GitHub for the remote repository.
Go to https://github.com/ and create an account.
After registering in the GitHub homepage, click on Start a Project to create a new Git repository. Give the repository a name and click “Create Repository”

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Give the name as git-blog-demo.

1. Connect local to the Remote repository:
   In order to point your local repository to the remote repository, use the following command:
   >git remote add origin [repository url]
   >git remote add origin https://github.com/phuongtp/git-blog-demo.git

2. Push all code from local to remote repository:
   >git push -u origin master

3. Git Pull
   Additional Commands, is used to pull the latest canhges from the remote repository into the local repository.  
   The remote repository code is updated continuously by various developers, hence git pull is necessary:
   >git pull origin master

4. Git Clone
   git clone is used to clone an existing remote repository into your computer. The command for this is:
   >git clone https://github.com/phuongtp/git-blog-demo.git
